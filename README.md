# AMBA's Lameathon
This is a set of APIs with very different objectives. I had a lot of fun in writing them!

In total there are 6 hacks in one:

1. Dynamic Okta Badges
2. Bring the Action! (CLI abuse)
3. "Progessiver"
4. Action's Engine Explorer - Web shell (Platform abuse)
5. Tenant Token Request (CLI abuse)
6. FGA Preview* (Not everything is what it seems, CLI abuse)

After submitting this, I have to open two security tickets so that the team, who are specialists in this, could analyse concerns that I was left with.

### 1. Dynamic Okta Badges

This generated dynamic SVG badges including Okta's common Okta Icons. The parameters can be changed, but three default ones have been created (Auth0, Okta, FGA). The text has to be URL encoded.

Query Params:
- label
- labelColor
- color
- icon
- scale

Examples:

#### Auth0
`/api/badges/bta/This%20is%20the%20first%20badge?label=Auth0`

![Badge 1](https://lt.a0.gg/api/badges/bta/This%20is%20the%20first%20badge)
#### Okta with customised colours
`/api/badges/okta/An%20Okta%20Badge?labelColor=000000&color=purple`

![Badge 2](https://lt.a0.gg/api/badges/okta/An%20Okta%20Badge?labelColor=000000&color=purple)
#### FGA 2X Size
`/api/badges/api/badges/fga/Fantasy%20Games%20Association?scale=2`

![Badge 3](https://lt.a0.gg/api/badges/fga/Fantasy%20Games%20Association?scale=2)


### 2. Bring the Action
The idea behind this hack is to be able to add buttons to perform operations on an Auth0 tenant. In this case, imagine that inside a Github repository, you want to add a button (using the badges!) that allows you to take your source code and deploy it to your Auth0 tenant.

This demo saves actions in your tenant. Click on the badge below to save an action to your tenant that you can configure with secrets and dependencies!

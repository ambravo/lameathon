This is a set of APIs with very different objectives. I had a lot of fun in writing them!

In total there are 5 hacks in one:

1. Dynamic Okta Badges
2. Bring the Action! (CLI abuse, security request ticket to follow)
3. "Progessiver"
4. Action's Engine Explorer - Web shell (Platform abuse, security request ticket to follow)
5. FGA Preview* (Not everything is what it seems, CLI abuse)
6. Tenant Token Request (CLI abuse)

# AMBA's Lameathon
This is a set of APIs with very different objectives. I had a lot of fun in writing them!

In total there are 6 hacks in one:

1. Dynamic Okta Badges
2. Bring the Action! (CLI abuse)
3. "Progessiver"
4. Action's Engine Explorer - Web shell (Platform abuse)
5. Tenant Token Request (CLI abuse)
6. FGA Preview* (Not everything is what it seems, CLI abuse)

After submitting this, I have to open two security tickets so that the team, who are specialists in this, could analyse concerns that I was left with.

### 1. Dynamic Okta Badges
